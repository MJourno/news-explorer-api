# lint-deps [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lint-deps.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/lint-deps)

> CLI tool that tells you when dependencies are missing from package.json and offers you a choice to install them. Also tells you when dependencies are listed in package.json but are not being used anywhere in your project. Node.js command line tool and API.

## Install

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i -g lint-deps
```

## CLI

In the command line, run:

```bash
deps
```

### Commands

* `-r` | `--report`: save a report to disk. By default `report.json` is saved. To change the path do: `-r foo.json`
* `-e` | `--exclude`: comma-separated list of files or directories to exclude. Example: `deps -e test,lib`

## Examples

If everything is good, you'll see something like this:

### Install missing packages

If packages are missing, you'll see a prompt like this (also shows which files require the package):

**If you choose <kbd>yes</kbd>:**

**choose dependencies**

Works the same way for `devDependencies`:

**choose "nothing, just install"**

Now hit <kbd>enter</kbd> and everything that was checked will be installed.

**If you choose <kbd>no</kbd>:**

Done.

## API

```js
var deps = require('lint-deps');

// pass the directory to scan
console.log(deps('lib'));
```

## Manually define dependencies

When dependencies are defined in a format that isn't recognized by lint-deps, like with grunt tasks (e.g. `grunt.loadNpmTasks()`), you can manually specify these dependencies in code comments, similar to jshint commands.

**Example**:

Make sure `deps` is the first thing, and pass a space separated list of module names:

```js
/** deps: foo bar baz */
```

If you use [verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb), you can use HTML code comments in your `.verb.md` file:

```html
{%= reflinks() %}
<!-- deps: helper-reflinks -->
```
